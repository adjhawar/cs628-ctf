Exploited format string vulnerability in auth.
gave key as %x%x.... to get stack content (hence the key in hex)
also had to use %lf etc to go beyond limit of 39 chars
Searched for "flag" in hex in the stack content and copied the key in front of it (keepinf little endian in mind)
Converted hex to characters
